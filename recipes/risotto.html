            <li>16 fluid ounces bottled clam juice</li> 
            <li>1 (6.5 ounce) can chopped clams, drained with juices reserved</li> 
            <li>&frac14 cup butter</li> 
            <li>1 yellow onion, chopped </li> 
            <li>2 cups Arborio rice </li> 
            <li>&frac34 cup white wine </li> 
            <li>&frac12 teaspoon saffron  </li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li> 
            <li>8 ounces cooked salmon </li> 
            <li>kosher salt </li>
            <li>ground black pepper</li>   
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place water, bottled clam juice, and reserved juice from canned clams into a medium saucepan. Set over medium-high heat; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>In a large pot or deep skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in onion, and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in rice, and cook, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes. Do not let rice brown. Pour in wine, and cook, stirring, until the wine is evaporated. Add 1/2 cup of simmering broth, and stir until the broth is almost all evaporated. Then add another 1/2 cup of broth. Stir in saffron and basil. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time and stirring until the liquid has evaporated until the rice is almost al dente, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the inside of the rice is slightly more firm than you desire in the final dish, stir in clams, flaked salmon, and 1/2 cup broth. Stir until the liquid evaporates. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in 1/2 cup broth, and stir vigorously. Remove from heat before the liquid has completely evaporated.</li>
            
        </ol>
